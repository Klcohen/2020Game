<div class="scenario">
    <p>Asthma is likely a reason why they are experiencing those symptoms. An individual 
        that experiences hoarseness of their voice is a sign of congestion and swelling 
        in the airways, which could cause their throat to close up and potentially result in death. 
        Informing the EMTâ€™s of this symptom ensures they receive a tube down their throat for oxygen and avoids the potential for disaster. </p>
    <h2>Great Job!</h2>
