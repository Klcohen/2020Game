<div class="scenario">
    <p>The information provided by the paramedic is crucial for understanding the medication they can administer to treat 
        the patient. They do not want to cause an allergic reaction that would cause the hikerâ€™s condition to worsen. In addition, 
        if they have any pre-existing conditions like diabetes for example, that requires special medication that is unique to them. </p>
    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>After you speak with the paramedics about the burn patient, you continue to assist with the search and rescue efforts. 
        You stumble upon a local resident who got caught up in the fire and they are sitting in a smokey area. They appear to be 
        out of breath and you notice that their eyes look red. What should you do?</p>
