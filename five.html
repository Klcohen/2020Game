    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>The previous shift has taken the med bag out of the fire truck to change the batteries and restock the medical equipment. However, they forgot to put it back as they were tied up at the end of their shift and the current shift does not have access to it.
        <span> <br> </span>
        When you encounter the injured hikers, you open up the compartment and find that the bag is not there. The hikers lack critical medical attention and with the ambulance 30 minutes away, the situation is dire.
