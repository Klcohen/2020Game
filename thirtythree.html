    <h3>Here are the rules</h3>
    <p>You pick between 2-3 choices. Your decision will impact the outcome of the game. There are XXX outcomes of the game- see if you can find them all.
        All scenarios are based on firefighter training and meant to improve your decision-making skills</p>

<div class="scenario">
    <h2> Below lists a few methods firefighters use to mitigate the spread of wildfires:</h2>
<p>Personnel <br>
    Engine strike team <br>
    Five fire engines with a lead vehicle <br>
    3 or 4 firefighters on each truck <br>
    In the game, the firefighter from San Francisco would follow the engine strike team format</p> <br> <hr>
<p>   Fire Strike team <br> 
    These firefighters are heavily trained and can respond to fires without additional support or very minimal.  <br>
    Minimal staffing is 30 firefighters <br></p> <hr> <p>
    Control line <br>
    Natura Wildfire (e.g on a river or a cliff) <br>
    A natural landscape could prevent the spread of the fire by creating an environment in which future spread is hindered <br> </p> <hr> <p>
    Humanmade Wildfire <br>
    Firefighters could purposely burn brush or dead vegetation in order to reduce the fuel that the fire could use to spread <br>
    It is important to note that when a fire that is considered contained means the fire has been merely contained within the control line or the perimeter set up of the fire. <br></p> <hr> <p>
    Backburn<br>
    This approach is typically set up after a control line is established. Firefighters perform a controlled burn inside an area and push the fire up to the main fire while burning all the fuel or dead vegetation in between.<br>
