    <p>You pick between 2-3 choices. Your decision will impact the outcome of the game. There are XXX outcomes of the game- see if you can find them all.
        All scenarios are based on firefighter training and meant to improve your decision-making skills</p>

<div class="scenario">
    <p>Correct! You want to carry the burn bag because you heard over the 
        radio that the patient was burned, which the burn bag contains special 
        burn ointment and medicine you may need. However, you also want to carry 
        the Class B Trauma kit because this kit provides you with additional 
        tools and equipment that you would not find in your typical standard-issue bag. </p>
    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>An experienced firefighter says “Great job! Let’s head out to the burn patient!”  
        When you arrive and you ask him where it hurts? He replies that he is experiencing 
        no pain but you notice that the burn mark has already burnt through the outlier 
        of the skin and looks white.
        What kind of burn is this?</p>
