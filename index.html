    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>The sun is barely up when you receive a call from the fire station “Mornin’.  We have a wildfire on our hands. Get to the station right away- all hands on deck.” You quickly gather your belongings and head out to the station with your coffee in hand. </p>
    <br>
    <p>When you arrive, you are debriefed about the situation:
        “A couple eager to announce the gender of their baby has accidentally set the nearby land on fire and due to the dry conditions surrounding the area, the fire has spread to a considerable size already.”
