<div class="scenario">
    <p>Correct. We want to apply ice packs on 
        the body including the torso, neck and 
        groin area to help regulate body temperature. 
        This is also the site where large blood 
        vessels lie close to the skin surface 
        which can help cool the patient down. But 
        remember you do not want to cause shivering 
        when treating the patient. </p>
    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>The hiker is sitting in a shaded area and 
        you hand them a water bottle to drink. You 
        notice the fire is spreading and your fellow 
        firefighters are trying to contain the fire. 
        It appears that they may need some extra help. 
        What do you do?
