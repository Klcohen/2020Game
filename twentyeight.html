    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>The hiker was suffering from smoke inhalation and needed to be evacuated from what was causing their symptoms as soon as possible. Other symptoms of smoke inhalation include: coughing, noisy breathing, soot in the nostrils or throat, and hoarseness in voice. </p>
    <p>As you bring the local resident back to your truck they begin coughing and you realize they are spitting up black mucus -  they are showing symptoms of smoke inhalation. Luckly, you got them out of the smoke so you are ready to provide them with treatment. What should you do?</p>
    <p>(note if answered in correctly you will remain on this page until you've found the correct answer)</p>
