    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>After you provide the paramedics with the relevant information about the hiker, you hear over the radio that one of the members of the Gender Reveal party attempted to put out the fire but instead has suffered burns all over his arm and legs. You must act fast to treat him to reduce the risk of infection and shock which can lead to death. One of the firefighter task forces has an ATV for you to hop onto to go to the scene.  Which bags do you carry with you?</p>
<p>(note if answered in correctly you will remain on this page until you've found the correct answer)</p>
